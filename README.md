Read me file:

This project shows the source code for my final year project which runs on Android.
This application has been written by Serour Benbouza unless commented otherwise in the code.

How to run the project: 

Since my apk file is bigger than 25MB it cannot be uploaded to github or QMplus. Hence, I cannot provide an executable file directly.  In order to run the code and test the application you will need to follow the following instructions which I have obtained from Github:
https://github.com/openaps/AndroidAPSdocs/blob/master/docs/EN/Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.md 

Files for project:
The code is hosted on GitHub and can be found through the link:
