Read me file:

This project shows the source code for my final year project which runs on Android.
This application has been written by Serour Benbouza unless commented otherwise in the code.

How to run the project: 

In order to run the apk file (app-debug.apk) , you will need to install the Bluestacks Appplayer and run the apk file that I have included. This is a developer tool but will enable you to see the application on an emulator.

Files included:
All java code, xml code and resources have been pushed to this GitHub repository
